# Mobile Flashcards
Mobile application (Android and iOS) that allows users to study collections of flashcards, create different categories of flashcards called "decks", add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

This is the final assessment project for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)'s [React Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

The project has been tested and confirmed to be working successfully on iOS 10.
